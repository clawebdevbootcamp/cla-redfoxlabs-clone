Here are some of the questions that came into my mind while doing this project:
1. Relative and Static Units > For paddings, margins and so, are we supposed to use only
relative units so the layout changes depending on the screen size, or is it okay to use
static units from time to time? I don't know but each time I use static units I feel like
cheating (for example, I used static measurements for get started button so even when the
screen size changes, the looking + width/height of the button stays the same). I don't know
If there's an overall rule or something.
2. I don't kow if I am doing thing wrong since I am doing a lot of media queries, I feel
like I have to change the font-size as the screen size goes smaller and stuff? should I
do a relative font-size or is it normal to change these kind of things manually?
3. There's something about the button #more-about-us I dunno why applying margin and changing
its width doesn't work, I tried to figure out why and I just didn't find the reason.
